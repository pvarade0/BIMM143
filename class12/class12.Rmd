## Prep for docking
We want to produce a protein- only PDB file and a drug only PDB file.

```{r}
library(bio3d)

#DOWNLOAD THE pdb File using get.pdb("1hsg"), but i already have it.
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg.pdb")
protein <- atom.select(pdb, "protein", value= TRUE)
write.pdb(protein, file= "1hsg_protein.pdb")
```

and for ligand
```{r}
ligand <- atom.select(pdb,"ligand", value=TRUE)
write.pdb(ligand, file="1hsg_ligand.pdb")
                      
```
 
 Put in the 1hsg_protein.pdbqt/ligand file that we made in AutoDockTool
